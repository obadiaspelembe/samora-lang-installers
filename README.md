# Samora lang Installers
This repository provides scripts to install Samora Lang compiler in various Operating Systems

## How to install

### Windows
Download the [Windows Installer](https://github.com/obadiaspelembe/samora-lang-installers).

I really recommend installing golang in your host, although it is not mandatory.

```powershell
./installer.ps1
```

:warning: NOTE: Make sure you set `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` before you execute this command if it's first time working with powershell scripts. Also make sure you have installed git in your host.
